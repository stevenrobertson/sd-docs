@article{Dippel2002,
abstract = {Contrast enhancement of radiographies based on a multiscale decomposition of the images recently has proven to be a far more versatile and efficient method than regular unsharp-masking techniques, while containing these as a subset. In this paper, we compare the performance of two multiscale-methods, namely the Laplacian Pyramid and the fast wavelet transform (FWT). We find that enhancement based on the FWT suffers from one serious drawback-the introduction of visible artifacts when large structures are enhanced strongly. By contrast, the Laplacian Pyramid allows a smooth enhancement of large structures, such that visible artifacts can be avoided. Only for the enhancement of very small details, for denoising applications or compression of images, the FWT may have some advantages over the Laplacian Pyramid.},

@inproceedings{Mainland2010,
annote = {Nikola actually accomplishes a fair bit of what I originally intended to do with the Haskell (well, Python first) combinator approach, where programs would be built from regular functions using a whole bunch of desugaring behind the scenes. There's an enormous advantage to this approach, which is that the programmer doesn't have to learn (too much of) a new language outside of the one s/he's working in. There's also a severe limitation, in that the only expressions which can be clearly described are those which form a subset of both the embedded and host languages. Ultimately, I judged that constructing a new syntax was the right choice, because this subset was too limiting and because it was far too easy to express code that would run unexpectedly slowly using the combinators, but Nikola's still useful as a point of reference. \~{}\~{}sr},

Now, place still smaller equilateral triangles in the center of each of the star's 12 sides. Repeat this process infinitely and you have a Koch snowflake, a mind-bending geometric figure with an infinitely large perimeter, yet with a finite area. This is an example of the kind of mathematical puzzles that this book addresses. The Fractal Geometry of Nature is a mathematics text. But buried in the deltas and lambdas and integrals, even a layperson can pick out and appreciate Mandelbrot's point: that somewhere in mathematics, there is an explanation for nature. It is not a coincidence that fractal math is so good at generating images of cliffs and shorelines and capillary beds.},
